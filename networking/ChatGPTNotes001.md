To create a C++ program that provides additional networking information for Conky, you can write a simple network monitoring tool. This tool will gather networking information and output it in a way that Conky can use. You can then call this C++ program from your Conky configuration using ${exec} or ${execi}.
Step 1: Writing the C++ Program

Here’s an example C++ program that gathers basic network information, such as the interface name, IP address, transmitted and received bytes, etc.
Example C++ Program (network_info.cpp):

cpp

#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <string>
#include <sstream>
#include <cstdlib>

std::string get_network_interface() {
    std::ifstream interfaces("/proc/net/dev");
    std::string line, iface;

    while (std::getline(interfaces, line)) {
        std::istringstream iss(line);
        std::string name;
        if (iss >> name) {
            // Skip lo (loopback interface)
            if (name != "lo:") {
                iface = name.substr(0, name.size() - 1); // Remove trailing ':'
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    return iface;
}

std::string get_ip_address(const std::string &interface) {
    std::string cmd = "ip addr show " + interface + " | grep 'inet ' | awk '{print $2}' | cut -d/ -f1";
    std::string ip;
    std::array<char, 128> buffer;
    std::shared_ptr<FILE> pipe(popen(cmd.c_str(), "r"), pclose);
    if (!pipe) return "N/A";
    while (fgets(buffer.data(), buffer.size(), pipe.get()) != nullptr) {
        ip += buffer.data();
    }
    return ip;
}

void get_network_usage(const std::string &interface, long &rx_bytes, long &tx_bytes) {
    std::ifstream dev_file("/proc/net/dev");
    std::string line;

    while (std::getline(dev_file, line)) {
        if (line.find(interface) != std::string::npos) {
            std::istringstream iss(line);
            std::string iface;
            if (iss >> iface) {
                long rx, tx;
                iss >> rx >> std::ws;
                for (int i = 0; i < 7; ++i) iss >> std::ws;
                iss >> tx;
                rx_bytes = rx;
                tx_bytes = tx;
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    std::string iface = get_network_interface();
    if (iface.empty()) {
        std::cerr << "No active network interface found.\n";
        return 1;
    }

    std::string ip = get_ip_address(iface);
    long rx_bytes, tx_bytes;
    get_network_usage(iface, rx_bytes, tx_bytes);

    std::cout << "Interface: " << iface << "\n";
    std::cout << "IP Address: " << ip;
    std::cout << "Received Bytes: " << rx_bytes << "\n";
    std::cout << "Transmitted Bytes: " << tx_bytes << "\n";

    return 0;
}

Step 2: Compile and Install the Program

    Save the above code to a file named network_info.cpp.

    Compile the program using g++:

    bash

g++ -o network_info network_info.cpp

Copy the compiled binary to /bin:

bash

    sudo cp network_info /bin/

Step 3: Update Conky Configuration

Now that the C++ program is installed, you can integrate it into your Conky configuration using ${exec} or ${execi}.

Here’s an example of how you might modify your Conky config to call this program:

lua

conky.text = [[
${font Ubuntu Mono:size=12}${alignc}${time %A, %d %B %Y}
${font Ubuntu Mono:bold:size=24}${alignc}${time %H:%M:%S}

# Network Info
${font Ubuntu Mono:size=12}NETWORK ${hr 2}
${execi 10 /bin/network_info}
]];

    ${execi 10 /bin/network_info}: This tells Conky to execute the network_info program every 10 seconds and display its output.

Step 4: Restart Conky

After editing the configuration, restart Conky to apply the changes:

bash

killall conky && conky

This setup will now use your custom C++ program to provide additional network information for Conky. You can modify the C++ program to add more detailed network statistics if needed!

is there a way to see a wifi cards actie radio mode?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT

Yes, you can check a Wi-Fi card's active radio mode (e.g., 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n, 802.11ac, or 802.11ax) using a few different methods in Linux. Below are some common ways to find this information:
1. Using iwconfig

The iwconfig command provides information about wireless interfaces, including the current mode.

Run the following command:

bash

iwconfig

You will see output similar to this:

mathematica

wlp2s0    IEEE 802.11  ESSID:"YourNetworkSSID"  
          Mode:Managed  Frequency:2.437 GHz  Access Point: 12:34:56:78:9A:BC   
          Bit Rate=144.4 Mb/s   Tx-Power=20 dBm   
          Retry short limit:7   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off
          Power Management:on
          Link Quality=70/70  Signal level=-39 dBm  
          Rx invalid nwid:0  Rx invalid crypt:0  Rx invalid frag:0
          Tx excessive retries:0  Invalid misc:0   Missed beacon:0

In this case, the line starting with IEEE 802.11 indicates the radio standard (e.g., IEEE 802.11 without a suffix can imply 802.11b/g/n).

However, this method doesn't explicitly list the specific radio mode (e.g., 802.11n vs 802.11ac). For more precise information, you can use iw.
2. Using iw (Modern and Precise)

The iw command provides more detailed information than iwconfig. Here’s how to use it:

bash

iw dev wlp2s0 link

Replace wlp2s0 with your Wi-Fi interface name. The output might look something like this:

yaml

Connected to 12:34:56:78:9A:BC (on wlp2s0)
        SSID: YourNetworkSSID
        freq: 5180
        RX: 893407 bytes (5219 packets)
        TX: 149504 bytes (662 packets)
        signal: -50 dBm
        tx bitrate: 866.7 MBit/s VHT-MCS 9 80MHz short GI

    The freq line gives the operating frequency (e.g., 5180 MHz is a 5 GHz channel).
    The tx bitrate line provides the transmit speed and modulation type. VHT-MCS 9 indicates that it is using 802.11ac (VHT refers to Very High Throughput, used in 802.11ac).

3. Using nmcli

You can also use nmcli, a command-line tool for NetworkManager, to get information about your Wi-Fi connection, including the active mode.

Run the following command:

bash

nmcli device wifi list ifname wlp2s0

This will show detailed information about nearby Wi-Fi networks, including the radio mode:

arduino

IN-USE  SSID             MODE   CHAN  RATE        SIGNAL  BARS  SECURITY  
*       YourNetworkSSID  Infra  36    1300 Mbit/s  100     ▂▄▆█  WPA2

The RATE (e.g., 1300 Mbit/s) suggests that 802.11ac is being used, as only 802.11ac/ax can achieve such high bit rates.
4. Using iwlist

The iwlist command can also give you details about supported frequencies and modes, though it might be less precise for the current connection. You can use the following command:

bash

sudo iwlist wlp2s0 scan | grep -i '802.11'

This scans for nearby Wi-Fi networks and should show the radio modes in use by different access points.
5. Parsing /proc/net/wireless

You can also view a summary of the wireless interface statistics:

bash

cat /proc/net/wireless

This shows basic statistics, but it doesn’t provide as much detail about the radio mode as iw or nmcli.
Using this Data in Your C++ Program

You could integrate the iw command within a C++ program to retrieve and parse this information.

Here’s a sample C++ snippet to execute the iw command and capture the output (simplified for clarity):

cpp

#include <iostream>
#include <array>
#include <memory>

std::string get_wifi_mode(const std::string &interface) {
    std::string cmd = "iw dev " + interface + " link";
    std::array<char, 128> buffer;
    std::string result;
    std::shared_ptr<FILE> pipe(popen(cmd.c_str(), "r"), pclose);
    if (!pipe) return "N/A";
    while (fgets(buffer.data(), 128, pipe.get()) != nullptr) {
        result += buffer.data();
    }
    return result;
}

int main() {
    std::string iface = "wlp2s0";  // Replace with your interface
    std::string wifi_info = get_wifi_mode(iface);
    std::cout << "Wi-Fi Info:\n" << wifi_info << std::endl;
    return 0;
}

This program executes iw dev wlp2s0 link and prints the output, which you can further parse to

extract the specific radio mode.

How can I use grep to only collect the interfaces that are in use? Such as ignore the ones that end with "no wireless extensions."

u can run iwconfig and use grep to filter out the lines that contain the phrase "no wireless extensions.".

bash
